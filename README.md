# Iris-Classification

This is a Python script that performs classification on the popular Iris flower dataset from scikit-learn.  Pytorch, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and time were used.  The model trains on 80% of the dataset, and tests on the last 20%.


The code can be downloaded and ran with little setup.  If Pytorch has not been installed, run the following command:
```python
pip3 install torch torchvision
```
